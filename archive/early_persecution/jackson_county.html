        <h1>Early Persecution of Mormons in Jackson County, Missouri</h1>
        <p>
            Jackson County was first settled by early Mormon missionaries after Joseph Smith, founder, prophet, and president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, received a revelation that the location of the prophesied Zion, or New Jerusalem, would be in Jackson County, Missouri. Soon after, Mormons began to purchase land and settle there en masse. Between 1832 and 1833, the county's Mormon population had grown from about 100 Mormons to an estimated 1,200 Mormons, making up nearly half of the area's population (Harper, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
            As the number of Mormons in the area grew, so too did tensions between the Mormons and the county's original inhabitants. Many of the residents feared that Mormon expansion would displace them. William W. Phelps, editor of the local Mormon printing press The Evening and the Morning Star, did nothing to help matters. He often wrote about the Mormon's vision for the area, "a quest that would eliminate any â€˜gentiles,' that is, original inhabitants of Jackson County" (Van Orden, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
            Reverend Benton Pixley, a local religious leader who opposed the Mormon's presence, further inflamed tensions by publishing inflammatory tracts, accusing the Mormons of being false prophets, ultimately inciting the local community against the Mormons. This conflict of ideas ultimately contributed to widespread anti-Mormon sentiment amongst the non-Mormons. The original residents, wary of the Mormons' communal lifestyle, also accused them of being economically exclusive, as the Mormons traded almost entirely with the church store and other affiliated shops. Racial tensions further worsened the situation. Many of the Mormons, being from northern states like New England, New York (where Mormonism originated), and Ohio, held mild abolitionist views, which didn't sit well with the largely pro-slavery Jackson County populace. Additionally, while settlers feared Native Americans, Mormon teachings highlighted a prophetic role for them, which led locals to worry that the Mormons might ally with Native tribes. These factors, alongside the rapid influx of Mormons, made the original settlers anxious about being outnumbered and losing political control over their county. In July 1833, tensions reached a boiling point. Vigilante mobs destroyed the Mormon printing press, scattered their materials, and violently attacked members, including tarring and feathering Bishop Edward Partridge. A forced agreement eventually expelled the Mormons from the county, leading many to seek refuge in neighboring counties, especially Clay County (Van Orden, 2018).
        </p>
            <!-- <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The socio-economic and cultural distinctions between the groups added to the tensions. The original settlers, wary of the Mormons' communal lifestyle, accused them of being economically exclusive, since the Mormons "traded entirely with the church store or mechanical shops" (Van Orden "Terror In Jackson County"). Racial tensions further worsened the situation. Many of the new settlers from northern states held mild abolitionist views, which did not sit well with the largely pro-slavery Jackson County populace. Although Phelps clarified that the church was not trying to attract free Blacks to the area, his prior abolitionist leanings, coupled with rumors that Mormons were interfering with slaves, only intensified hostility. Additionally, while settlers feared Native Americans, Mormon teachings highlighted a prophetic role for them, which led locals to worry that the Mormons might ally with Native tribes. These factors, alongside the rapid influx of Mormons, made the original settlers anxious about being outnumbered, creating fears of losing political control over the county. In response, prominent local leaders circulated a petition in July 1833, declaring that they would rid Jackson County of "this Mormon menace â€˜as by the law of self-preservation'" (Van Orden "Terror In Jackson County"). This culminated in a series of violent actions, property destruction, and a demand for the Mormons to vacate the county, leading to a tragic episode of forced migration and significant loss.
