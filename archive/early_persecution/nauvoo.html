        <h1>Persecution in Nauvoo, Illinois</h1>

        <h2>Building Nauvoo</h2>
        <p>
            While Joseph Smith remained imprisoned in Missouri, other church leaders purchased land in the mostly vacant Commerce area in Hancock County. Upon Smith's escape and arrival in Commerce in May of 1839, he renamed the town Nauvoo, a Hebrew word meaning "to be beautiful." Despite its inspiring name, Nauvoo began as an inhospitable swamp rife with disease, but through hard work, the Saints drained the nearly 800-acre swamp and rapidly developed the settlement into a thriving community (Boyd and Black, 2015; "Nauvoo During the Mormon Period").
        </p>

        <h2>Tensions Brewing</h2>
        <p>
            A crucial part of the deal was that the Mormons were restricted to settling only in Caldwell County, and just south of Caldwell County was a strip of land called Bunkham's Strip, a twenty-four-mile-long by six-mile-wide strip of no-man's land where nobody was allowed to settle—a barrier between the Mormons and the non-Mormon citizens of Ray County ("Battle of Crooked River"). In 1836, the Mormons began establishing the town of Far West in Caldwell County as their headquarters within Missouri. However, in 1837, after a financial crisis and internal dissentions rocked the church's original headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio in 1837, the church moved its headquarters to Far West, Missouri, bringing with it an influx of settlers, with hundreds of members pouring into Missouri (Birzer). As a result, Mormons began to establish new colonies outside of Caldwell County, including Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County and De Witt in Carroll County, under the argument that the agreement only restricted major settlements in Clay and Ray Counties ("Adam-ondi-Ahman"). Nonetheless, many non-Mormons saw this as a breach of the compromise, reigniting tensions in the area, as local settlers viewed the growing Mormon presence as a political and economic threat.
        </p>
        <p>
            A group of vigilantes from Clinton, Platte harassed and displaced Mormons in Daviess County, prompting them to seek refuge in Adam-ondi-Ahman. Mormon leaders called up militia forces and the Danites (a Mormon vigilante group), who retaliated by attacking and burning Missourian settlements, including Gallatin, Millport, and Grindstone Fork. The Mormons looted property, destroyed homes, and displaced non-Mormon families (Knip, 2020).
        </p>
        <h2>Missouri Executive Order 44</h2>
        <p>
            Fearing the same level of attack, many non-Mormon Ray County families fled across the Missouri River for safety. A militia under the command of Samuel Bogart was tasked with patrolling Bunkham's Strip and keeping the peace. Unexpectedly, instead of staying in the strip, Bogart crossed into Caldwell County and began to harass, disarm, and threaten Mormons. Hearing that Mormons were taken prisoner and at risk of execution, an armed rescue party was quickly dispatched by Mormon leaders. During the ensuing battle named The Battle of Crooked River after the river along which it was fought, the Mormons clashed with Bogart's militia, successfully repelling them but suffering heavy casualties. Exaggerated reports claiming Bogart's entire company was massacred fueled panic across Missouri. Governor Lilburn Boggs, already hostile to Mormons, viewed the incident as an insurrection. On October 27, 1838, he issued Missouri Executive Order 44, also known as the "Extermination Order", declaring the Mormons to be enemies of the state and ordering their extermination or removal (Knip, 2020).
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
            "Since the order of this morning to you..., I have received...information of the most appalling character, which...places the Mormons in the attitude of an open and avowed defiance of the laws, and of having made war upon the people of this state. Your orders are, therefore, to hasten your operation with all possible speed. The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace—their outrages are beyond all description. If you can increase your force, you are authorized to do so to any extent you may consider necessary..." (Boggs, 1838).
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="reference">— Governor Lilburn Boggs, 1838</div> -->
        <h2>Haun's Mill Massacre</h2>
        <p>
            Tensions reached a breaking point in October of 1838 when, after local dissenters falsely claimed that Mormon's at Hawn's Mill were planning a raid, a mob of 250 Missourians attacked the settlement, killing 17 people, including children. Attempts to negotiate were ignored, and Mormon defenders who sought shelter in a blacksmith shop were slaughtered when attackers fired through its gaps. The massacre, including the execution of a ten-year-old, shocked survivors and forced the Mormons to surrender, an event that would later be called Hawn's Mill Massacre. No Missourians were ever prosecuted for this violence. 
            On November 1 of that year, the Mormon stronghold at Far West came under siege. Mormon leaders, including Joseph Smith, surrendered and were subsequently arrested. The Mormons were disarmed, forced to pay for damages, stripped of property, harassed by mobs, and warned to leave Missouri by spring of 1839 ("Hawn's Mill Massacre").         
        </p>
        <h2>Expulsion from Missouri</h2>
        <p> 
            The Saints faced severe hardships during their departure. Many families lacked adequate food, clothing, or shelter, enduring freezing temperatures and snow. Women, children, and the elderly were particularly vulnerable, with some families forced to camp in wagons or makeshift tents. Accounts detail bleeding feet on frozen ground, insufficient clothing, and starvation. Despite these hardships, communal efforts helped organize the move, with committees formed to assist the poorest members (Hartley, 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
            Most fled across the Mississippi River to Illinois, where they received aid from compassionate Quincy residents appalled by Missouri's actions, providing the Mormons with food, lodging, and employment opportunities ("Quincy, Illinois, Settlement"). Settling in the abandoned town of Commerce, the Mormons renamed it Nauvoo and began rebuilding their community ("Nauvoo (Commerce), Illinois").
